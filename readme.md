## 📍 Overview

The RARFS Automator project streamlines the installation process of rar2fs by automating the setup, managing dependencies, compiling rar2fs and UnRAR sources, and optimizing recompilation speed. This open-source tool fetches the latest version, downloads required components, installs UnRAR, configures rar2fs, and leverages ccache for improved recompilation efficiency. The project significantly simplifies the installation and setup of rar2fs, enhancing the overall user experience.
